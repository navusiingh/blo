                <time>November 11th 2022</time>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is shaping the future of humanity across nearly every industry. It is already the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and IoT, and it will continue to act as a technological innovator for the foreseeable future.
                    <br>AI is important because it forms the very foundation of computer learning. Through AI, computers have the ability to harness massive amounts of data and use their learned intelligence to make optimal decisions and discoveries in fractions of the time that it would take humans.</p>

                <time>November 18th 2022</time>
                <p>Datafication is a technological trend turning many aspects of our life into data.This technology was introduced in 2013 by Kenneth Cukier and Viktor Mayer-Sch√∂nberger and since then Datafication has developed a lot.<br>
                Datafication helps businesses improve their products and services by using real-time data. Companies like Insurance, Banks, and sectors like Human resources and Social sciene reseachers use datafication to better their products and services.</p>

                <time>November 25th 2022</time>
                <p>Starlink is the world's first and largest satellite constellation using a low Earth orbit to deliver broadband internet capable of supporting streaming, online gaming, video calls and more.<br>

                    Leveraging advanced satellites and user hardware coupled with our deep experience with both spacecraft and on-orbit operations, Starlink delivers high-speed, low-latency internet to users all over the world.<br>
                    Starlink is a satellite constellation system that aims to deliver global internet coverage. This system is ideally suited for rural and geographically isolated areas where internet connectivity is unreliable or nonexistent.<br> Starlink satellite has a lifespan of approximately five years and SpaceX eventually hopes to have as many as 42,000 satellites in this so-called megaconstellation.</p>

                <time>December 2nd 2022</time>
                <p>Nanotechnology involves the understanding and control of matter at the nanometer-scale. The so-called nanoscale deals with dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers.<BR>It is also known as Nano-tech.<BR>the engineering of small machines that use matter of atomic, molecular and supramolecular scales for industrial purposes. It is the process of manipulating atoms and molecules to manufacture macroscale products or molecular nanotechnology. The development of nanotech and its branches would be the result of a manufacturing revolution, which making impossible thing, the possible.</p>
